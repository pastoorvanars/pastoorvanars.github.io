        "content": "In 1963, architect <a href='https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Aldo_van_Eyck' target='_blank' rel='noopener noreferrer'>Aldo van Eyck</a> (1918-1999) was commissioned to design a Roman Catholic church for a new parish in Kijkduin, on the edge of 'Meer en Bos' in The Hague. In 1969, the Church of Saint Pastor of Ars was consecrated. Friends and foes expressed their admiration: the building was bold, unique in its kind. The unconventional Van Eyck, now a professor in Delft, had broken with almost all building traditions within the Catholic Church, without compromising the sacred atmosphere. <br> <br>The church is constructed from large concrete blocks and has no windows except on the side of the residential house, but features domes in the roofs. The building resembles a blockhouse and is often referred to as 'the bunker'. Once inside, one is impressed by the tranquility, the space, and the light, or as one visitor describes it: 'This building appeals to one&apos;s senses.'",
        "content2":"\"...It is from this accumulated secular experience that I started on both the present and the previous church (‘The Wheels of Heaven’), confident that specific paradoxes appertaining to the subject could still be translated into architecture.<br><br>Far from wishing to secularize (i.e. neutralize or banalize) what for others is sacred, I have in both cases tried, as an outsider, to mitigate the outworn hierarchy’s irreversibility; persuading it to become hence more reversible- relative. Only the mild gears of reciprocity I thought could help me here. <br><br>The available rectangular site was prohibitively small, so I decided to limit the overall plan of the church to a single rectangle, thus giving up the idea of gradual entry that a complex periphery allows. This time entry is so sudden that only the church doors become the sole representation of that idea. Having descended towards the entry from street level, one slips in from the side one by one through the narrow door which opens inwards and leaves with others after mass through the wide one which opens outwards. Light enters sideways through tiny square panes where the two doors overlap. ‘Entry’ starts, as. it were, once one is inside! An unavoidable limitation but at any rate architecturally resolved in the details of the doors .",
        "content3":"As to the interior of the church, I wished to combine the quality of a low crypt-like space with that of a tall gothic-like one. Low when seated during mass; tall when walking (after entry and befare leaving). Because it was so narrow- only 3.40 m between the columns- 11 m seemed high enough for the tall space, and 2.50 to 3.50 not too low for the low one, if sufficiently articulated horizontally, and – this in particular- also vertically; for, generally speaking, the articulation of height is still a neglected facet of contemporary architecture. There has been little sense of right-height in today’s buildings since the minds of 20th-century architects began to function only laterally! What my wife once called the interior horizon of space is nowadays sadly missing.<br>The tall space – neither narthex nor nave, but something of both – beca me a kind of interior street with the divers sacred places strung along it. People filter out of and into it from end to end between the semicircular chapels, piers and outer walls. All three spaces open upwards into spacious circular drums above, through which light fa lis onto altar and people alike.",
        "content4": "In front, the church is situated 1 m below the original street’level, thus reducing its bu lk as well as the depth of the canal. This artificial difference in level between the entries on either side made it possible to incline the floor of all three church spaces at a right angle to the axis of the altar. Thus the tilt, for once, became a counter tilt! There are three levels for the low part and five for the tall part, between the two entries. So one either ascends or descends, depending on which entry is used. The altar stands halfway down the middle level. For those passing it in either direction up or down the ‘sacred way’ it is a mild and.relative place, I thought. However for those seated in the low crypt-like space during mass, no arbitrary tampering with the altar’s place on the lateral axis- as so often occurs todays- is allowed to disturb the significant equipoise that the traditional place ensures.",
        "content5": "Except for the altar, which I designed, all the ecdesiastical objects were introduced by those who believe in them. l just provided the places to receive them. There are also no built-in sacred signs or symbols of any kind anywhere, nor any church bells to alarm people still asleep.\"",

        "content": "Jean Marie Baptiste Vianney was appointed as pastor in the small parish of Ars-sur-Formans (near Villefranche-sur-Saône) in France in 1818. He only finds the small village of sixty houses when a shepherd boy shows him the way. Over the years, the pastor of Ars develops into a true shepherd of souls, a highly gifted confessor. The small church quickly becomes too small for the influx of thousands of believers from all directions who wish to confess to the pastor of Ars. Since the parishioners do not want to part with their little church, the new church is built as a forecourt to the old church. The life of hearing confessions weighs heavily on the pastor of Ars, but he perseveres through the strength of his faith and the support of St. Philomena (a Roman martyr from the 4th century). <br><br>On August 4, 1859, the pastor of Ars passes away, already regarded as a saint by his parishioners during his lifetime. At his deathbed, a young priest prayed these words: “Veniant illi obvium Sancti Angeli Dei et perducant eum in civitatem coelestem Jerusalem” (“May the Holy Angels of God go to meet him to lead him into the heavenly Jerusalem.”).",
        "content2": "In 1905, he was beatified by Pope Pius X and proclaimed the patron of all priests who practice pastoral care in France. In 1924, he was canonized by Pope Pius XI. Jean Marie Baptiste Vianney rests in the newly built basilica of Ars-sur-Formans. His heart is located in a reliquary in the Chapelle du Coeur. Since 1929, the Pastor of Ars has been the patron saint of all pastoral caregivers. His feast day is August 4.<br><br>The Church of St. Pastor of Ars in Kijkduin is simple. And so was the church in Ars-sur-Formans: “First, he came into the church. It was simple, and that pleased him.”"
